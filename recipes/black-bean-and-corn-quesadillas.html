        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can of black beans, drained and rinsed</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) can of whole kernel corn, drained</li>
            <li>1/4 cup salsa</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, or as needed</li>
            <li>8 (8 inch) flour tortillas</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot oil until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in beans and corn, then add salsa, brown sugar, and red pepper flakes; mix well. Cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Melt about 1 ½ teaspoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Place a tortilla in the skillet. Sprinkle with ¼ of the Monterey Jack cheese, then top with ¼ of the bean mixture. Place another tortilla on top; cook until the bottom is golden, then carefully flip and cook until the other side is golden. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.</li>
